\title{Translation validation of a pattern-matching compiler}
\author{Francesco Mecca, Gabriel Scherer}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We propose an algorithm for the translation validation of a pattern
matching compiler for a small subset of the OCaml pattern
matching features. Given a source program and its compiled version the
algorithm checks wheter the two are equivalent or produce a counter
example in case of a mismatch.

Our equivalence algorithm works with decision trees. Source patterns are
converted into a decision tree using matrix decomposition.
Target programs, described in a subset of the Lambda intermediate
representation of the OCaml compiler, are turned into decision trees
by applying symbolic execution.
\end{abstract}
\section{Translation validation}
A pattern matching compiler turns a series of pattern matching clauses
into simple control flow structures such as \texttt{if, switch}, for example:

\hspace{-3em}
\begin{minipage}{0.4\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
  match li with
  | [] -> (0, None)
  | x::[] -> (1, Some x)
  | _::y::_ -> (2, Some y)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.6\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
(if li
    (let (tl =a (field 1 li))
        (if tl
            (let (y =a (field 0 tl))
                (makeblock 0 2 (makeblock 0 y)))
            (let (x =a (field 0 li))
                (makeblock 0 1 (makeblock 0 x)))))
    (makeblock 0 0 0a))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

The code on the right is in the Lambda intermediate representation of
the OCaml compiler. The Lambda representation of a program is shown by
calling the \texttt{ocamlc} compiler with \texttt{-drawlambda} flag.

The pattern matching compiler is a critical part of the OCaml compiler
in terms of correctness because bugs typically result in wrong code
production rather than compilation failures.
Such bugs also are hard to catch by testing because they arise in
corner cases of complex patterns which are typically not in the
compiler test suite or most user programs.
In the last five years there were (only) two known bugs in the OCaml pattern
matching compiler; they resulted in silent wrong-code production,
and were found long after they were introduced.

We would like to keep evolving the pattern matching compiler, either by
using a new algorithm or by incremental refactorings.
We want to verify the changed compiler to ensure that no bugs were
introduced.

One could either verify the compiler implementation
(full verification) or check each input-output pair
(translation validation). We chose translation validation; it gives
a weaker result but is much easier to adopt in a production
compiler. The pattern-matching compiler is treated as a blackbox and proof only depends
on our equivalence algorithm between source and target programs.

It would be very challenging to consider equivalence checking at the
scale of a source-to-binary native compiler. In contrast, the
pattern-matching compiler is a specific subsystem where we expect
equivalence checking to be feasible in practice.

\section{Decision Trees}

Our algorithm translates both source and target
programs into a common representation, \emph{decision trees}.
Here are the decision tree for the source and target example programs.

~

\hspace{-2em}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
\begin{verbatim}
       Switch(Root)
       /        \
     ([])       (::)
     /             \
   Leaf         Switch(Root.1)
(0, None)       /         \
              ([])        (::)
             /               \
          Leaf              Leaf
   [x = Root.0]         [y = Root.1.0]
   (1, Some x)          (2, Some y)
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
\begin{verbatim}
       Switch(Root)
       /        \
     (= int 0)  (!= int 0)
     /             \
   Leaf         Switch(Root.1)
(makeblock 0     /       \
  0 0a)         /         \
             (= int 0)    (!= int 0)
             /               \
          Leaf              Leaf
[x = Root.0]            [y = Root.1.0]
(makeblock 0            (makeblock 0
  1 (makeblock 0 x))      2 (makeblock 0 y))
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}

~

\texttt{Root.0} is an \emph{accessor}, it represents the
access path to a value that can be reached by deconstructing the
scrutinee (\texttt{li} in our example), in this case the first
subvalue of the scrutinee.

Source conditions test the head constructor of the accessor, whereas
target conditions test the low-level representation of values in
Lambda code. For example, cons cells \texttt{x::xs} or tuples
\texttt{(x,y)} are heap blocks (with tag 0), while the empty list
\texttt{[]} is the immediate integer \texttt{0}.

In this simple example, the two decision trees perform exactly the
same checks in the same order, so their equivalence is
obvious. However, this is not the case in general, as the compiler may
reorder checks and simplify away redundant checks.

\paragraph{Computing a source decision tree}

To compute the decision tree of a source program we use the standard
approach of \emph{matrix decomposition}. A pattern matrix is an
intermediate datastructure that represents matching on several values
in parallel. Each column of the matrix matches on a sub-value of the
original scrutinee, denoted by an accessor $a_i$. For example, the
matrix on the left corresponds roughly to the tuple pattern on the
right:

\begin{minipage}{0.4\linewidth}
\begin{mathpar}
\begin{array}{lllll}
\phantom{(}a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & & \\
(p_{1,1} & p_{1,2} & p_{1,3} & \to & e_1) \\
(p_{2,1} & p_{2,2} & p_{2,3} & \to & e_2) \\
\end{array}
\end{mathpar}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.6\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
match ($a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$) with
| ($p_{1,1}$, $p_{1,2}$, $p_{1,3}$) -> $e_1$
| ($p_{2,1}$, $p_{2,2}$, $p_{2,3}$) -> $e_2$
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

~

The central operation is to \emph{decompose} a given matrix by looking
at the variant constructors that occur in the first column -- $(p_{1,1}$,
$p_{2,1})$ in our example. For each constructor we compute a smaller
\emph{submatrix} containing the rows that match this constructor.


For example, the decomposition of the matrix on the left gives the two
submatrices on the right, one for the \texttt{Some} constructor and
one for \texttt{None}.

\begin{mathpar}
\begin{array}{lllll}
\phantom{(}a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & & \\
(\mathtt{Some}(q) & p_{1,2} & p_{1,3} & \to & e_1) \\
(\any & p_{2,2} & p_{2,3} & \to & e_2) \\
(\mathtt{None} & p_{3,2} & p_{3,3} & \to & e_3) \\
\end{array}

\begin{array}{l}
{\begin{array}{lllll}
\phantom{(}{a_1}.0 & a_2 & a_3 & & \\
(q & p_{1,2} & p_{1,3} & \to & e_1) \\
(\any & p_{2,2} & p_{2,3} & \to & e_2) \\
\end{array}}
\\[2em]
{\begin{array}{llll}
\phantom{(}a_2 & a_3 & & \\
(p_{2,2} & p_{2,3} & \to & e_2) \\
(p_{3,2} & p_{3,3} & \to & e_3) \\
\end{array}}
\end{array}
\end{mathpar}

We build a decomposition tree by repeating this decomposition step. At
each step we emit a \texttt{Switch} node on the accessor of the first
column. We have one sub-tree per submatrix, and the branch condition
checks for the submatrix constructor.

We emit a leaf node when repeated decomposition reaches a matrix with
empty rows (no columns).

\paragraph{Computing a target decision tree}

The target programs include the following Lambda constructs:
\texttt{let, if, switch, Match\_failure, catch, exit, field} and
various comparison operations, guards. A simple symbolic execution
engine traverses the target program, keeping an environment that maps
variables to accessors. It branches at every control flow statement
and emits a \texttt{Switch} node. The branch condition $\pi_i$ is
expressed as an interval set of possible values at that point.

For example, consider the Lambda fragment
%
\lstinline{if (= x 0) e1 e2)}.
%
We build a \lstinline{Switch} node with two children, one for
\lstinline{e1} and one for \lstinline{e2}. We get the accessor
corresponding to \lstinline{x} in the symbolic environment, and the
branch conditions of the two subtrees would correspond respectively to
\lstinline{= 0} (the domain $[0]$) and \lstinline{!= 0} (the domain
$[\mathtt{min\_int}; -1] \cup [1; \mathtt{max\_int}]$).

\section{Checking equivalence}

We now give a simplified sketch of our equivalence
algorithm. See the appendices for more details.

To check the equivalence of a source and a target decision tree,
we proceed recursively by case analysis.
%
If we have two leaves, we check that the target right-hand-side is the
compilation of the source right-hand-side, and that the captured
environments are identical over their free variables.
%
If we have a Switch node $N$ and another tree $T$ we check equivalence for
each child of $N$. A child is a pair of a branch condition
$\pi_i$ and a subtree $D_i$. For every child $(\pi_i, D_i)$ we
\emph{trim} $T$ by killing the branches that are incompatible with
$\pi_i$, and check that the trimmed tree is equivalent to $D_i$.

\paragraph{Contributions} We have chosen a simple subset of the OCaml
language and implemented a prototype equivalence checker along with
a formal statement of correctness and proof sketches.

Our source language supports integers, lists, tuples and algebraic
datatypes. Patterns support wildcards, constructors and literals,
or-patterns $(p_1 | p_2)$ and pattern variables. We also support
\texttt{when} guards, which require the evaluation of expressions
during matching. As they may perform side-effects, the evaluation of
these guard expressions may not be reordered, erased or duplicated.

Our current implementation prototype can be found at:

\appendix
\appendixpage

In these appendices we are trying to show the minimal amount of
formalism to describe our equivalence algorithm in a precise way, and
explain how we reason about its correctness -- what the correctness
statements are. We omit as many details as the explanation can afford
(hopefully) to keep the document concise.

\section{A more formal setting}

We will use, but not define by lack of space, the notion of source and
target \emph{programs} $t_S$ and $t_T$, and \emph{expressions} $e_S$
and $e_T$. A source program $t_S$ is a list of pattern-matching
clauses (with an optional \texttt{when}-guard) of the form
\lstinline{| $p$ (when $e_S$)? -> $e_S$}, and a target program $t_T$
is a series of control-flow conditionals (\texttt{if, switch,
  Match\_failure, catch, exit}), value access (\texttt{field}),
variable bindings (\texttt{let}) and comparison operators in Lambda
code, with arbitrary Lambda-code expressions $e_T$ at the leaves.

We assume given an equivalence relation $\erel {e_S} {e_T}$ on leaf
expressions. In our translation-validation setting, it suffices to
relate each source expression to its compiled form -- the compiler
gives/computes this relation. We have to lift this relation on leaves
into an equivalence procedure for (pattern-matching) programs.

\begin{mathpar}
  \erel {e_S} {e_T} \; (\text{\emph{assumed}})

  t_S(v_S),\ t_T(v_T),\ \vrel {v_S} {v_T} \; (\text{\emph{omitted}})

  \resrel {r_S} {r_T}, \runrel {R_S} {R_T} \; (\text{\emph{simple}})
\\
  \begin{array}{l@{~}r@{~}r@{~}l}
    \text{\emph{environment}} & \sigma(v)
    & \bnfeq & [x_1 \mapsto v_1, \dots, v_n \mapsto v_n] \\
    \text{\emph{closed term}} & \cle(v)
    & \bnfeq & (\sigma(v), e) \\
  \end{array}
\quad
  \begin{array}{l@{~}r@{~}r@{~}l}
    \text{\emph{matching result}} & r(v)
    & \bnfeq & \NoMatch \bnfor \Match {\cle(v)} \\
    \text{\emph{matching run}} & R(v)
    & \bnfeq & (\cle(v)_1, \dots, \cle(v)_n), r(v) \\
  \end{array}
\\
  \infer
  {\forall x,\ \vrel {\sigma_S(x)} {\sigma_T(x)}}
  {\envrel {\sigma_S} {\sigma_T}}

  \infer
  {\envrel {\sigma_S} {\sigma_T} \\ \erel {e_S} {e_T}}
  {\clerel {(\sigma_S, e_S)} {(\sigma_T, e_T)}}

  \infer
  {\forall {\vrel {v_S} {v_T}},\quad \runrel {t_S(v_S)} {t_T(v_T)}}
  {\progrel t_S t_T}
\end{mathpar}

We use $v_S$ and $v_T$ for source and target values, and define
a relation $\vrel {v_S} {v_T}$ to relate a source to a target value;
this relation (omitted by lack of space) captures our knowledge of the
OCaml value representation, for example it relates the empty list
constructor \texttt{[]} to $\Int 0$. We can then define \emph{closed}
expressions $\cle$, pairing a (source or target) expression with the
environment $\sigma$ captured by a program, and what it means to
``run'' a value against a program or a decision, written $t(v)$ and
$D(v)$, which returns a trace $(\cle_1, \dots, \cle_n)$ of the
executed guards and a \emph{matching result} $r$.

Once formulated in this way, our equivalence algorithm must check the
natural notion of input-output equivalence for matching programs,
captured by the relation $\progrel {t_S} {t_T}$.

\section{Decision trees}

The parametrized grammar $D(\pi, e)$ describes the common structure of
source and decision trees. We use $\pi$ for the \emph{conditions} on
each branch, and $a$ for our \emph{accessors}, which give a symbolic
description of a sub-value of the scrutinee. Source conditions $\pi_S$
are just datatype constructors; target conditions $\pi_T$ are
arbitrary sets of possible immediate-integer or block-tag values.
%
\begin{mathpar}
  \begin{array}{l@{~}r@{~}r@{~}l}
    \text{\emph{decision trees}} & D(\pi, e)
    & \bnfeq & \Leaf {\cle(a)} \\
    & & \bnfor & \Failure \\
    & & \bnfor & \Switch a {\Fam {i \in I} {\pi_i, D_i}} \Dfb \\
    & & \bnfor & \Guard {\cle(a)} {D_0} {D_1} \\
    \text{\emph{accessors}} & a
    & \bnfeq & \Root \;\bnfor\; a.n \quad (n \in \mathbb{N}) \\
  \end{array}
  \quad
  \begin{array}{l}
  \pi_S : \text{datatype constructors}
  \\
  \pi_T \subseteq        \{ \Int n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z} \}
                  \uplus \{ \Tag n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}
  \\[1em]
  a(v_S), a(v_T), D_S(v_S), D_T(v_T) \quad (\text{\emph{omitted})}
  \end{array}
\end{mathpar}
%
The tree $\Leaf \cle$ returns a leaf expression $e$ in a captured
environment $\sigma$ mapping variables to accessors.
%
$\Failure$ expresses match failure, when no clause matches the input
value.
%
$\Switch a {\Fam {i \in I} {\pi_i, D_i}} \Dfb$ has one subtree $D_i$
for every head constructor that appears in the pattern matching
clauses, and a fallback case for the constructors.
%
$\Guard \cle {D_0} {D_1}$ represents a \texttt{when}-guard on a closed
expression $\cle$, expected to be of boolean type, with sub-trees
$D_0$ for the \texttt{true} case and $D_1$ for the \texttt{false}
case.

We write $a(v)$ for the sub-value of the (source or target) value $v$
that is reachable at the accessor $a$, and $D(v)$ for the result of
running a value $v$ against a decision tree $D$; this results in
a (source or target) matching run $R(v)$, just like running the value
against a program.

\section{From source programs to decision trees: matrix decomposition}

We write $\sem{t_S}_S$ for the decision tree of the source program
$t_S$. It satisfies the expected correctness statement:
\[
\forall t_S, \forall v_S,
\quad
\runrel {t_S(v_S)} {\sem{t_S}_S(v_S)}
\]
Running any source value $v_S$ against the source program gives the
same result as running it against the decision tree.

The decision tree of a source program is in fact defined by the more
general operation of computing the decision tree of pattern matrix --
by a matrix decomposition algorithm.

A pattern matrix with rows indexed over $I$ and columns indexed over
$J$ is an object of the form
$(\Fam {j \in J} {a_j}, \Fam {i \in i} {\Fam {j \in J} {p_{i,j}} \to e_i})$
or, in more visual notation:
\begin{mathpar}
\begin{array}{lllll}
\phantom{(}a_1 & \dots & a_j & & \\
(p_{1,1} & \dots & p_{1,j} & \to & e_1) \\
& \dots \\
(p_{i,1} & \dots & p_{i,j} & \to & e_i) \\
\end{array}
\end{mathpar}

The usual intuition of a $J$-columns matrix $m$ is that it matches on
$J$ input values simultaneously, with a natural \emph{run} function
$m {\Fam {j \in J} {v_j}}$. This intuition does not suffice to
formulate a correctness statement, because we cannot directly relate
a matrix $m$ matching on $J$ inputs with a decision tree matching on
a single input. To formulate the correctness statement, we remark that
the $J$ input values fed to a matrix are sub-values of a common
value $v$, obtained through the accessors $\Fam {j \in J} {a_j}$.
For $m = (\Fam {j \in J} {a_j}, \dots)$
we have the following correctness statement:
\[
\forall t_S, \forall v_S,
\quad\implies\quad
\runrel {m {\Fam {j \in J} {a_j(v_S)}}} {\sem{m}_S(v_S)}
\]

\section{From target programs to decision trees: symbolic execution}

We write $\sem{t_T}_T$ for the decision tree of the target program
$t_T$, satisfying a correctness statement similar to the source one:
\[
\forall t_T, \forall v_T, \quad \runrel {t_T(v_T)} {\sem{t_T}_T(v_T)}
\]

\section{Equivalence checking}

During equivalence checking we traverse the two trees, recursively checking equivalence of pairs of subtrees.
When we traverse a branch condition, we learn a condition
on an accessor that restricts the set of possible input values that can flow in the corresponding subtree.
We represent this in our algorithm as an \emph{input domain} $S$ of possible values (a mapping from accessors to target domains).

The equivalence checking algorithm $\SimpleEquiv S {D_S} {D_T}$ takes an input domain \emph{S} and a pair of source and target decision trees. In case the two trees are not equivalent, it returns a counter example.

It is defined exactly as a decision procedure for the provability of the judgment
$(\Equivrel S {D_S} {D_T} \emptyqueue)$, defined below in the general
form $(\Equivrel S {D_S} {D_T} G)$ where $G$ is a \emph{guard queue},
indicating an imbalance between the guards observed in the source tree
and in the target tree. (For clarity of exposition, the inference rules do not explain how we build the counter-example.)
\begin{mathpar}
  \begin{array}{l@{~}r@{~}l}
    & & \text{\emph{input space}} \\
    S & \subseteq & \{ (v_S, v_T) \mid \vrel {v_S} {v_T} \} \\
  \end{array}

  \begin{array}{l@{~}r@{~}l}
    & & \text{\emph{boolean result}} \\
    b & \in & \{ 0, 1 \} \\
  \end{array}

  \begin{array}{l@{~}r@{~}l}
    & & \text{\emph{guard queues}} \\
    G & \bnfeq & (t_1 = b_1), \dots, (t_n = b_n) \\
  \end{array}
  \\
  \infer[empty]{ }
  {\Equivrel \emptyset {D_S} {D_T} G}

  \infer{ }
  {\Equivrel S \Failure \Failure \emptyqueue}

  \infer
  {\erel {t_S} {t_T}}
  {\Equivrel S {\Leaf {t_S}} {\Leaf {t_T}} \emptyqueue}

  \infer[explode-left]
  {\forall i,\;
    \Equivrel
      {(S \cap a = K_i)}
      {D_i} {\trim {D_T} {a = K_i}} G
   \\
   \Equivrel
     {(S \cap a \notin \Fam i {K_i})}
     \Dfb {\trim {D_T} {S(a) \cap a \notin \Fam i {K_i}}} G
  }
  {\Equivrel S
    {\Switch a {\Fam i {K_i, D_i}} \Dfb} {D_T} G}

  \infer[explode-right]
  {D_S \in {\Leaf t, \Failure}
   \\
   \forall i,\; \Equivrel {(S \cap a \in \pi_i)} {D_S} {D_i} G
   \\
   \Equivrel {(S \cap a \notin \Fam i {\pi_i})} {D_S} \Dfb G}
  {\Equivrel S
    {D_S} {\Switch a {\Fam i {\pi_i} {D_i}} \Dfb} G}

  \infer
  {\Equivrel S {D_0} {D_T} {G, (e_S = 0)}
   \\
   \Equivrel S {D_1} {D_T} {G, (e_S = 1)}}
  {\Equivrel S
    {\Guard {e_S} {D_0} {D_1}} {D_T} G}

  \infer
  {\erel {e_S} {e_T}
   \\
   \Equivrel S {D_S} {D_b} G}
  {\Equivrel S
    {D_S} {\Guard {e_T} {D_0} {D_1}} {(e_S = b), G}}
\end{mathpar}

The \Rule{empty} rule states that two subtrees are equivalent when the
input domain is empty. This is used when the two subtrees constrain
the input in incompatible ways.

The explosion rules are used when a \textsf{Switch} node occurs on
either side. Each child of this switch is tested for equality against
the other tree. The branch condition of the child is used to refine
the input domain. For example, if a source child is conditioned on the
head constructor $K$, this child is checked in the restricted domain
$S \cap a = K$, where $a = K$ is implicitly understood as the set of
related value pairs $\vrel {v_S} {v_T}$ where the head constructor of
$a(v)$ is $K$.

As an optimization, in the \Rule{explode-left} rule we \emph{trim} the
target tree, by simplifying the tree in depth with the source
condition. Trimming a target tree on a domain $\pi$ computed from
a source constructor $K$ means mapping every branch condition $\pi'$
of every node of the target tree to the intersection $\pi \cap \pi'$
when the accessors on both sides are equal, and removing the branches
that result in an empty intersection. If the accessors are different,
$\pi'$ is left unchanged.  Trimming avoids redundant work, because
each target subtree removed (in one step) by trimming would have been
traversed during the equivalence computation of each source subtree
and their children, potentially many times.

We have only defined trimming of a target tree, not of a source tree:
the branch condition on the source tree are just constructors, so they
are less expressive than target domains and it is hard to define an
intersection between the two. We restrict the \Rule{explode-right}
rule to only work on terminal source trees, so that no duplicate work
occurs.

There is no guarantee that the guards will appear at the same tree
level on both sides: guards cannot be reordered (their evaluation may
perform observable side-effects), but they can be permuted with
(non-observable) switches. We store a \emph{guard queue} $G$ that
tracks the guard conditions that we have traversed in the source tree,
but not yet in the target tree, with the boolean result of each
condition.
%
Termination of the algorithm (in the \textsf{Failure} and
\textsf{Leaf} rules) is successful only when the guards queue is
empty. This ensures that both sides executed the same guards, in the
same order.

The algorithm respects the following correctness statement:
\begin{align*}
 \SimpleEquiv S {D_S} {D_T} = \Yes
 & \implies
 \forall {\vrel {v_S} {v_T}} \in S,\; \runrel {D_S(v_S)} {D_T(v_T)}
\\
 \SimpleEquiv S {D_S} {D_T} = \No {v_S} {v_T}
 & \implies

The inference rules above do not describe how to build
a counter-example in the \textsf{No} case; our algorithm corresponds
to a complete inference procedure that always succeeds, and builds
a counter-example in the cases where the equivalence judgment does not
hold. This is much heavier to describe in inference-rule notation,
and best understood by looking at the code of our software prototype.

\section{Complete procedure}

Putting all the pieces together, we have a sound and complete decision
procedure to check the equivalence of a source program $t_S$ and
target program $t_T$. The correctness argument follows from composing
together the correctness statements of each part.
\\
(We write $\top$ for the full domain of all pairs
$\vrel {v_S} {v_T}$.)
\begin{mathpar}
  \SourceEquiv {t_S} {t_T} \quad:=\quad \SimpleEquiv \top {\sem{t_S}_S} {\sem{t_T}_T}
\\
  \SourceEquiv {t_S} {t_T} = \Yes

  \implies

  \forall {\vrel {v_S} {v_T}},
  \qquad
  \runrel
      {\runrel {t_S(v_S)\;} {\;\sem{t_S}_S(v_S)}\;}
      {\;\runrel {\sem{t_T}_T(v_T)\;} {\;(t_T)(v_T)}}
\\
 \SourceEquiv {t_S} {t_T} = \No {v_S} {v_T}

 \implies

 \vrel {v_S} {v_T} \quad\land
 \qquad
 \nparamrel{run}
      {\runrel {t_S(v_S)\;} {\;\sem{t_S}_S(v_S)}\;}
      {\;\runrel {\sem{t_T}_T(v_T)\;} {\;(t_T)(v_T)}}
\end{mathpar}
